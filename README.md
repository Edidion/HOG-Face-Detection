# HOG-Face-Detection
This project uses a  detection technique called Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to detect specific features in an image. 

In most cases, HOG presents better results than the Haars Cascade Classifier. It uses a mathematical concept called derivative to measure the rate of color variation. The value of the derivative is small when the variation of colors is small. A gradient vector is also used to indicate the direction in which the values increase.
